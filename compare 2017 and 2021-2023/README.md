<h1> Comparing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) concentrations collected in 2017 v. 2021-2023. </h1>

<p>Figure: This map shows the location of military installations with at least one exceedance of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)â€™s proposed standard of 4 parts per trillion (ppt) in the combined dataset. The larger the circle, the higher the concentration of PFAS. </p>

This code compares military installations in both the 2017 and 2021-2023 datasets. If an installation is in both datasets, than the reported PFAS concentrations for those installations are compared. 22 military installations are in both datasets.

All data was scraped from the Department of Defense's publicly available PFAS website: https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/eer/ecc/pfas/map/pfasmap.html. 

<b>Highlighted Capabilities:</b>

<i>1. Automating some of the matching process using fuzzy matching.</i>

<i>2. Joining data from one dataframe to another. </i>

<i>3. Highlighting rows if the concentrations in 2017 were lower than concentrations in 2021-2023.</i> Note the highlighting does not appear on GitHub. 

<i>4. Analyzing the data using descriptive statistics and generating a histogram.</i>

<i>5. Creating a map of installations that exceed screening levels.</i>

<b>Inputs:</b>

<i>1. 2017 PFAS dataframe.</i> Dataframe that contains PFAS concentrations in drinking water on or near military installations collected as of 2017. Please see the "2017 PDF scrape" folder in this repository for the code that scrapes a PDF file for the 2017 data. 

<i>2. 2021-2023 PFAS dataframe.</i> Dataframe that contains PFAS concentrations in drinking water on military installations collected in 2021-2023. Please see the "2021-2023 webscrape" folder in this repository for the code that webscrapes the 2021-2023 data. 

<b>Output:</b> A single dataframe containing joined data for military installations present in both the 2017 and 2021-2023 datasets. 22 installations were present in both. Two of the installations reported concentrations that were higher in 2021-2023 than 2017. The rows for these installations were highlighted. 

<b>Methods:</b>
1. Import stored 2017 and 2021-2023 dataframes.
2. Rename some of the military installations in both dataframes in order to improve the match.
3. Use fuzzy matching to create a dataframe which contains a similarity score for the best match between the two dataframes based on military installation name.
4. Filter the fuzzy dataframe to only keep installations with a similarity score greater than or equal to 87%.
5. Filter the 2017 dataframe to only keep specific columns needed.
6. Join / merge the 2017 dataframe to the fuzzy dataframe.
7. Highlight rows where the concentrations in 2021-2023 was higher than in 2017.
8. Combine the datasets together and select highest concentration regardless of year.
9. Compare each results to screening levels. 
10. Analyze the results using descriptive statistics and a histogram.
11. Create a map of installations with highest concentrations.
