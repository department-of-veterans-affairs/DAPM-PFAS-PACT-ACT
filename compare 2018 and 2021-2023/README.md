<h1> Comparing Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) concentrations collected in 2018 v. 2021-2023. </h1>

This code compare PFAS concentrations collected in drinking water on or near military installations in 2018 v. 2021-2023. 22 military installations were in both datasets. 

All data was scraped from the Department of Defense's publicly available PFAS website: https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/eer/ecc/pfas/map/pfasmap.html. 

<b>Highlighted Capabilities:</b>
<i>1. Automating some of the matching process using fuzzy matching.</i>
<i>2. Joining data from one dataframe to another. </i>
<i>3. Highlighting rows if the concentrations in 2018 were lower than concentrations in 2021-2023.
