<h1>Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in drinking water on or near military installations, 2017 and 2021-2023</h1>

This repository contains the Python code written to scrape data on the concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) collected in drinking water systems on or near military installations.  DOD collected these samples to identify potential impacts of PFAS resulting from DOD activities. DOD collected the samples between 2021 and 2023. This data was scraped from DOD's public PFAS website: https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/eer/ecc/pfas/map/pfasmap.html. 

This map also contains concentration of PFAS reported by DOD as of August 31, 2017. The data was scraped from a PDF available on DOD's PFAS website: https://www.denix.osd.mil/derp/denix-files/sites/26/2018/03/FY18-HASC-Brief-on-PFOS-PFOA_Mar2018.pdf.

The PFAS concentrations displayed are either Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) or Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) which are members of the PFAS chemical group. For the 2021-2023 data, only one PFOS or PFOA concentration is displayed for each military base, specifically the highest concentration of either PFOS or PFOA that was reported in the dataset. 

For the 2017 data, the concentrations were reported as a combination of PFOA and PFOS or the analyte was unspecified. Only one concentration is reported for each base with the exception that some bases had concentrations reported both on and off the base. In this situation, the highest concentration for both scenarios were reported. 

70 parts per trillion (ppt) and 4 ppt are concentrations that EPA has presented in the past and present to be used for evaluating the risk of PFOA and PFOS risk to human health. There are two different layers in the map for the 2021-2023 data, one that shows concentrations above 70 ppt in red and one that shows concentrations above 4 ppt in red. For the 2018 data, all concentrations were reported above 70 ppt. 

The layers in this map are intended to be view individually, not all together.

If a Result cell in the attribute table is blank, no concentrations were detected.
